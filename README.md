# Pub Quiz

A JSON API of trivia questions for a [pub quiz](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=pub+quiz&title=21st, "Chambers definition of pub quiz") game.[1] This version has one category: history. This is the route: `/history`

Website: https://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com

Repo: https://github.com/ThwCorbin/pub-quiz

This game is my sixth project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

## Technologies

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- HTML

## Features

I developed a bronze/silver/gold plan, which is available in the planning directory in this repo. I completed all bronze level features. I planned to add more categories of questions (e.g. Mythology, General Knowledge, etc.) in the silver and gold plans, but I've decided that for the purposes of this project (CRUD operations) one category will suffice. I will develop a front end for my next project to work with this back end.
